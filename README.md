# LLM RAG Chatbot with LangChain

This project implements a chatbot using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with LangChain, following the tutorial from [Real Python](https://realpython.com/build-llm-rag-chatbot-with-langchain/). The chatbot leverages the power of large language models (LLMs) combined with retrieval techniques to answer questions using both generated text and retrieved context from a specified dataset.

## Features

- **RAG Architecture**: Utilizes Retrieval-Augmented Generation to enhance chatbot responses with relevant context.
- **LangChain Integration**: Uses the LangChain library for seamless integration with LLMs and retrieval modules.
- **Context-Aware Responses**: Retrieves context from a custom dataset to ensure more accurate and detailed answers.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Built to offer an intuitive chat experience for users.

## Project Overview

This chatbot is designed to combine the knowledge of LLMs with the ability to search for and retrieve specific information from a dataset. This approach allows the chatbot to provide more accurate and contextually relevant answers by grounding its responses in external data sources.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- OpenAI API key (or a compatible LLM provider)
- Libraries such as LangChain, OpenAI, and any other dependencies mentioned in the tutorial.
